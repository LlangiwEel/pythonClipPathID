Copy all .svg files to /pythonClipPathID/svgFiles/
Navigate to /pythonClipPathID/ folder in the terminal
Type python copySubstring.py

All clip path IDs should be copied into clipPathIds.txt
Clip path classes will be copied to clipClass.txt

New runs of the script will APPEND the clip paths to what is
currently stored in the .txt files. If you intend to run the same
.svg files twice, please remember to clear the .txt files first.
